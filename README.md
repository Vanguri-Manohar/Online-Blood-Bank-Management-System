# Online-Blood-Bank-Management-System
A browser-based system called the Blood Bank Management System (BBMS) is created to store, process, retrieve, and analyze data related to the administrative and inventory administration within a blood bank. This project aims to keep all the data on blood donors, the various blood types that are available in each blood bank, as well as prior donors, and to aid blood banks in managing more effectively. After three months, previously contributed individuals will be deleted and added. The goal is to increase transparency in this industry, make it simple and free of corruption to acquire blood from a blood bank, and improve the efficiency of the blood bank management system. The application's front end is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript, and its back end is built using a MySQL database and PHP.
